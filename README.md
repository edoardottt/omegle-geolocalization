# omegle-geolocalization

**❗ Use a VPN when accessing Omegle ❗**

##### When you chat with a random stranger on Omegle you can access its IP address, and you can geo localize people using it.

Code by [Matt Upham](https://mattupham.com/)

1. Change the const `apiKey` in the first line with yours. You can obtain it on [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/)
2. Go to [omegle.com](omegle.com) and open Developer Tools.
3. Paste the code inside the Console (Working only for Video chat, not text).

If you have some problems using this, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN9cWpY5zUc).
