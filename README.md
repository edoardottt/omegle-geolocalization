**❗ Use a VPN when accessing Omegle ❗**

##### When you chat with random strangers on Omegle you can access their IP addresses, and you can geolocalize people.

Code by [Matt Upham](https://mattupham.com/)

1. Change the const `apiKey` in the first line with yours. You can obtain it on [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/)
2. Go to [omegle.com](https://www.omegle.com/) and open Developer Tools.
3. Paste the code snippet inside the Console (Working only for Video chat, not text).
